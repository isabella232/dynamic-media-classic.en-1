# Quick Start: Mixed Media Sets{#quick-start-mixed-media-sets}

 Mixed Media Sets give users an integrated viewing experience. Mixed Media Sets can include images, Image Sets, Swatch Sets, Spin Sets, and videos. Users can select different tabs within the Mixed Media Viewer to see the items in the different viewers. If no tabs are specified, all assets are displayed together in the swatch row.

Mixed Media Set Viewer Presets include community options for end users to embed code, copy URLs, and link to the main web site. Users can use these options to share information about products on their personal web sites or social networking sites.

This Mixed Media Sets Quick Start is designed to get up and running quickly with Mixed Media Set techniques in Adobe Dynamic Media Classic.

## 1. Upload the images, swatch files, and videos

Start by uploading the images, swatch files, and videos for your Mixed Media Sets. Because users can zoom on images in the Mixed Media Set Viewer, be sure you account for this ability when choosing images. Make sure that the images are least 2000 pixels in the largest size.

On the Global Navigation bar, select **[!UICONTROL Upload]** to upload files from your computer to a folder on Adobe Dynamic Media Classic.

See [Upload your files](uploading-files.md#uploading-your-files).

## 2. Create media sets for use within the Mixed Media Set

You can add images, Image Sets, Swatch Sets, Spin Sets, and videos to your Mixed Media set. Prepare the media sets before you add them to the Mixed Media Set.

See [Create an Image Set](creating-image-set.md#creating-an-image-set), [Create a Swatch Set](creating-swatch-set.md#creating-a-swatch-set), and [Create a Spin Set](creating-spin-set.md#creating-a-spin-set).

## 3. Create a Mixed Media Set

On the Global Navigation bar, go to **[!UICONTROL Build]** > **[!UICONTROL Mixed Media Sets]**. Drag the images, Swatch Sets, Image Sets, and videos onto the Mixed Media Set page. To add a soundtrack, drag an audio file to the Soundtrack box.

See [Create a Mixed Media Set](creating-mixed-media-set.md#creating-a-mixed-media-set).

## 4. Set up Mixed Media viewer presets

Adobe Dynamic Media Classic comes with default viewer presets for Mixed Media Sets. Administrators can create or modify Mixed Media Set viewer presets.

When setting up a Mixed Media Set viewer preset, add the viewer presets for all the other assets in your set. For example, if your Mixed Media Set includes videos, add a video viewer preset to the Mixed Media Set viewer preset. You can also add a soundtrack to the viewer. This soundtrack plays while the viewer is open, but does not play when a video is active.

See [Set up a Mixed Media Set Viewer Preset](setting-mixed-media-set-viewer.md#setting-up-a-mixed-media-set-viewer-preset) and [Create and edit Viewer Presets](application-setup.md#adding-and-editing-viewer-presets).

## 5. Preview a Mixed Media Set

Select the Mixed Media Set’s **[!UICONTROL Preview]** button. You can select the thumbnail and swatch icons to examine your Mixed Media Set in the Mixed Media Set Viewer. You can choose different Viewers from the Presets menus.

See [Preview an asset](previewing-asset.md#previewing-an-asset).

## 6. Publish a Mixed Media Set

Publishing a Mixed Media Set places it on Adobe Dynamic Media Classic servers and activates the URL string.

Mixed Media Sets require that you publish to **Video Server** and also to **Image Server**. You use **Video Server** to publish the actual videos that you marked for publishing. And, you use **Image Server** to publish related assets, such as the video thumbnails, and set information for any Adaptive Video Set.

See [Publish a Mixed Media Set](publishing-mixed-media-set.md#publishing-a-mixed-media-set).

## 7. Link a Mixed Media Set to a web page

Adobe Dynamic Media Classic activates URL calls for Mixed Media Sets after you publish them. You can copy these URLs from the Preview page.

Select the Mixed Media Set, and then select **[!UICONTROL Preview]**. In the Preview page, select a Mixed Media Set Viewer Preset, and then select **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]**. See [Link a Mixed Media Set to a web page](linking-mixed-media-set-web.md#linking-a-mixed-media-set-to-a-web-page).
