# Preview a Spin Set{#previewing-a-spin-set}

You can use Viewer List to preview how an asset appears on particular viewer type platform such as HTML5. Depending on the asset type and associated viewer that you have selected to preview, not all platforms are available in Viewer List.

See [Configure default viewers](application-setup.md#configuring_default_viewers).

See [Preview an asset](previewing-asset.md#previewing_an_asset).

**To preview a Spin Set:**

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, in the Show drop-down list, select the Spin Set asset type.
1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate the Asset folders that contain the Spin Set that you want to preview with a viewer.
1. Do one of the following:

   * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**. In the Asset window, below the thumbnail image, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer List]**.
   * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL List View]**. In the Asset window, select an asset, and then to the right of the thumbnail image, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer List]**.
   * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Detail View]**. On the same toolbar, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer List]**.

1. In the Viewer List window, in the table, select a viewer link to preview the asset in the selected viewer.
1. Close the displayed viewer.
