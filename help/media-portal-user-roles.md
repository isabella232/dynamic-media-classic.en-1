# Media Portal user roles{#media-portal-user-roles}

Media Portal provides the following roles, each with different access rights and permissions. When you sign up a user, you assign the user one of the following roles:

* **[!UICONTROL Media Portal Administrator]** - Can add and remove administrators, contributors, and users. The administrator can also set group access rights, manage FTP accounts, assign corporate-approved conversion formats (presets), send e-mail to Media Portal users, and view portal usage and storage reporting.

* **[!UICONTROL Media Portal User]** - Has access to folders and files. A user can only browse, preview, and download files. This role is suitable for channel or service partners that need access to your corporate-approved assets.

* **[!UICONTROL Media Portal Contributor]** - Can upload, preview, and browse files and metadata in areas to which an administrator has granted permissions. A contributor cannot download files. Contributors can edit metadata, change the names of files, move files to different folders, and delete files.

* **[!UICONTROL Media Portal Contributor-User]** - Has access to folders and files. A contributor-user can browse, preview, download, and upload images and metadata. Contributor-users can change the names of files, move files to different folders, and delete files.

This table describes the tasks that users with different roles can do. Administrators and contributor-users can do all the tasks listed in this table:
