# About uploading and publishing assets {#about-uploading-and-publishing-assets}

Your work in Adobe Dynamic Media Classic falls in three basic areas:

* Uploading file assets to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic.
* Managing your files so you can use them to build rich-media assets.
* Publishing your asset files to a Dynamic Media Classic server so that they are available for delivery to your website and application.

When you upload asset files to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic and when you publish asset files to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic servers, the system records these file transfers on the **[!UICONTROL Jobs]** page. You can go to this page to track and monitor your upload and publishing activities.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you upload a file, Adobe Dynamic Media Classic generates the URL for the file. This URL is not active until you publish the file.

<!-- >[!NOTE]
>
>A new Instant Publish feature was made available shortly after the release of Adobe Dynamic Media Classic 6.0. This feature, which publishes assets immediately with one step, is being rolled out gradually, replacing the **[!UICONTROL Mark for Publish]** functionality. Some users will continue to see the current interface and functionality for a while, until they are included in the rollout. In addition, some assets will continue to use the “Mark for Publish” process for a while after the rollout. -->
