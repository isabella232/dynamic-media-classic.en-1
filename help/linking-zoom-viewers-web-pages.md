# Link Zoom viewers to your web pages{#linking-zoom-viewers-to-your-web-pages}

Your web sites and applications access Dynamic Media Image Server content, including master images and associated zoom targets, and Zoom Viewer Presets, by way of URL strings or embedded code. These URL strings are activated during the publishing process. To place these URL strings or the embedded code in your web pages and applications, you copy them from Adobe Dynamic Media Classic.

>[!NOTE]

>The URL is not active until you publish the asset.

## Copy a Zoom viewer URL {#copying-a-zoom-viewer-url}

1. in the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the asset folder that contains the Zoom viewer whose URL you want to copy.

## Add Zoom viewer URLs to your web page {#adding-zoom-viewer-urls-to-your-web-page}

Typically, visitors zoom images on a website by first selecting a Zoom icon (often the icon shows the image of a magnifying glass). Selecting this icon launches a dynamic web page (ASP or JSP) that displays the image in a pop-up window. The pop-up window is where visitors actually zoom the image.
