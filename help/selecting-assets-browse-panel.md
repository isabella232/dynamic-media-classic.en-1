# Selecting assets in the Browse panel{#selecting-assets-in-the-browse-panel}

Select an asset in the Browse Panel so you can work with it. Use these techniques to select assets:

* **A single asset** - Click the asset (double-clicking opens the asset in Detail view).

* **Several assets** - Ctrl+click (Windows®) or Command+click (Macintosh) assets to select assets in different places on the Browse Panel. Shift+click (click one asset, and then Shift+click another) to select adjacent assets.

* **All assets in the Browse Panel** - Click **[!UICONTROL Select]** > **[!UICONTROL All]**.

* **No assets** - Click **[!UICONTROL Select]** > **[!UICONTROL None]**.
